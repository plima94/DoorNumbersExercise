# DoorNumbersExercise

Door number of city buildings (Medium: ~30 min)

A city is building 3 new buildings in the same street: a police station, a fire station and a
court. To do so, you were asked to get all possible permutations for door numbers between 1
and 99 taking into consideration:
1. The sheriff of the police station doesn’t want any odd numbers for his police stations.
2. The Fire chief only wants prime numbers for his fire station.
3. The court doesn’t allow any number that ends in 3 for their door number.
The output should return all possible permutations and the total number of permutations. It
should also respect the output format in the example below.


Example:
Output example considering possible door numbers between 1 and 4:
{4,1,2}
{2,1,4}
{4,2,1}
{2,3,1}
{4,3,1}
{4,3,2}
{2,3,4}
total: 7


 The first column is the police door number
 the second is the fire station door number
 the third is the court door number
 the last line has the total number of permutations
